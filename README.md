- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jim3081
- ðŸ‘€ I retired after a career starting at the dawn of the PC and developing a passionate interest in developing apps on a "blank sheet". A fascinating experience.

After a 5 year break I yearn for a purposeful problem solving project to keep the neurones firing, and hoping for a socially useful outcome as a product.
